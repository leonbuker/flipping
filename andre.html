In the Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics, Kant probes the possibility of a pure natural science as a part of his pursuit of pure metaphysics. As he investigates the possibility of experience as an integral part of natural science, he claims to find the ‘complete solution of the Humean problem’ (64), referring to Hume's scepticism that challenges any human knowledge about the empirical world. By differentiating phenomenal and noumenal objects, as well as prioritising the human mind as the point of departure over objects themselves, Kant manages to arrive at some necessity with which we can understand empirical objects. This essay unpacks the line of argumentation that Kant uses to restore reliable knowledge of the objects that we can most directly experience. Through this rigorous exploration, Kant offers a way out of the epistemic mist produced by Humean scepticism.
<p>
Kant’s divergence from Humean epistemology through the suggestion of synthetic a priori knowledge is a key foundation for his solution of the Humean problem. In Hume’s worldview, human knowledge is divided into ‘relations of ideas’ (analytic a priori) and ‘matters of fact’ (synthetic a posteriori). Analytic knowledge includes propositions that are true by virtue of the meaning of the ideas contained therein. For example, that ‘all bachelors are unmarried’ is considered analytic since the knowledge can be obtained simply by analysing the idea of ‘bachelors’. On the other hand, the proposition that ‘all bachelors are happy’ falls under synthetic knowledge since bachelors’ happiness is not true by definition. Synthetic knowledge is especially valuable since its ampliative nature allows it to add new knowledge to ideas. In Hume’s clear-cut dichotomy of knowledge, all synthetic knowledge is a posteriori. It is not derived from rational justifications but from experience, which can always change. From his point of view, then, synthetic knowledge is not necessary, or in other words, it is epistemically uncertain. While concepts such as substance and causality are important for our conventional understanding of empirical objects, Hume considers them synthetic a posteriori knowledge. This categorisation instills radical doubt into our knowledge of the empirical world. Nevertheless, by suggesting the possibility of synthetic a priori knowledge, Kant salvages concepts like substance and causality from the Humean abyss of uncertainty. In order to restore some epistemic certainty of the empirical world, Kant embarks on a complex task to situate these concepts within human cognition. 
<p>
Kant lays the foundation for his goal of epistemic certainty first by delineating the scope of human knowledge. In differentiating between the phenomenal realm and the noumenal realm, he asserts that we can only have knowledge about objects of experience, which belong to the former, whereas objects in themselves are epistemically inaccessible in the latter. This assertion is self-evident since any objects that we have access to must be experienceable, and as such, enter the phenomenal world by necessity when they are experienced. The acquisition of knowledge relating to an object is preconditioned by an act of cognition, or experience. In other words, all objects of knowledge pertain to objects of experience, and Kant’s arguments concerning pure natural science are solely concerned with such phenomenal objects. In fact, Kant explicitly defines ‘nature’ in the context of pure natural science as the ‘sum total of all objects of experience’ (48). Kant’s worldview, called ‘transcendental idealism’, underlies his understanding of metaphysics and further substantiates his specific task of suggesting a solution of the Humean problem. By delimiting the scope of human knowledge and focusing his epistemological concerns on the phenomenal realm as what is cognisable, Kant reveals the significance of human cognition itself for our knowledge of objects.
<p>
What follows from Kant’s transcendental idealism is his own ‘Copernican Turn’, in which he redirects epistemological enquiries away from the noumenal realm towards objects of experience and the structures of the mind that condition the possibility of experience. From the perspective of Kant, the unknowability of objects in themselves means epistemology necessarily studies objects of experience. Since all such objects must be experienceable or cognisable, Kant suggests possibility of experience itself and the conditions that allow human cognition as the point of departure for his task to restore epistemic certainty. In other words, his question is not ‘how can we derive knowledge from phenomenal objects?’, which is a question pursued by Hume. Such a line of enquiry only gives a negative response that denies any possibility of a priori knowledge since knowledge derived from phenomenal objects is necessarily a posteriori. On the contrary, Kant asks, ‘how can phenomenal objects be cognisable in the first place?’ If cognition is possible, and indeed it is, the answer to the Humean problem then lies in the conditions that allow any possible cognition. The ‘Copernican Turn’ is coined as such because it refers to how Copernicus revolutionised the discipline of astronomy by replacing the traditional model that centres the Earth with a heliocentric model that revolves around the Sun. In the same way, Kant's ‘Copernican Turn’ in epistemology is a breakthrough in trying to establish some epistemic certainty for our knowledge of the empirical world. By investigating the conditions that are not derived from experience but actually underlie the possibility of experience, Kant opens up a path to the possibility of synthetic a priori knowledge about objects of experience.
<p>
Comprehending the conditions that allow experience is based on Kant’s division of human cognition into two faculties: sensibility, which is responsible for intuitions, and understanding, which is responsible for concepts. When we attempt to cognise an object, the raw, unprocessed sensory information comes as a manifold that allows no concepts and thus no per se. For example, without an act of processing the sensory manifold coming from an object that is cognisable as an orange flower, it is simply composed of orange visual stimulations as part of my vision that are in themselves mere pixels. They function like disparate data points that are yet to be synthesised for cognition. For the orange flower to be fully cognised in the human mind, sensibility gives an intuition of the orange flower while understanding actively applies concepts to this intuition in an act of judgment. Through this investigation into the processes of human cognition, Kant basically shows that the world does not come carved up. In reality, the human mind actively applies pure concepts of the understanding to discern objects of experience that are not otherwise distinguishable in a manifold of sensory information.  These processes, including most significantly the application of the pure concepts of the understanding, serve as the conditions of any possible experience. As a result, knowledge of these processes is the synthetic a priori knowledge that Kant proposes since the conditions underlying the possibility of experience must be universally valid within the phenomenal realm, which is all that epistemology is concerned with. 
<p>
Now that the importance of the pure concepts of the understanding is recognised with regards to building synthetic a priori knowledge, it is also helpful to discern the pure concepts that most directly apply to the cognition of empirical objects. Within Kant's conception of the processes of human cognition, judgment is the act of applying concepts, which is an integral part of cognising an object of experience. One particular form is categorical judgments, which state that some substance is some predicate. This kind of judgment applies concepts in a way that is most pertinent for substance and attribute as pure concepts of the understanding, without which cognition would be impossible. For example, if we review the case of the cognisable orange flower, it can be seen that the orange visual stimulations corresponding to the flower are not per se a unity that is distinguished from whatever background that the orange flower is set against. It is the application of the pure concepts of the understanding in an act of categorical judgment that the flower is orange that helps the mind discern the manifold of sensory information and cognise specifically the orange flower that is experienced as a unity of substance with some specific attribute. In similar ways, causality is another pure concept that is a fundamental condition for human cognition of objects of experience. The cognisability of all objects of experience means they must be subject to these pure concepts that are a priori. In this way, Kant's synthetic a priori knowledge of the pure concepts of the understanding helps restore the reliability of the way we conventionally make sense of phenomenal objects.
<p>
While it is clear that Kant makes a forceful response to Hume’s scepticism by restoring a priori knowledge of pure concepts such as substance and causality, it is debatable whether he offers the ‘complete solution of the Humean problem’ that he proclaims in the Prolegomena. Most notably, while Kant suggests the universal validity of the pure concepts of the understanding insofar as they are understood as conditions underlying the cognition of any objects of experience, he does not offer any epistemic certainty in the specific concepts that correspond to specific phenomena. For example, if we take the pure concept of causality, it is so far concluded that all objects of experience must conform to causality to be cognisable. Even though all objects must be bound by cause-and-effect relationships, it is not known a priori what particular cause-and-effect relationship bounds specific objects. We can take a concrete example to further examine this problem. Simply because we have a priori knowledge that the burning of a piece of paper is a phenomenon that makes it bound by the pure concept of causality does not mean that we know a priori that its specific cause is the piece of paper being approached by fire. Realising that Kant’s solution of the Humean problem cannot be applied to particular objects of experience returns epistemology back to Humean scepticism. Hume’s famous problem of induction relies on the idea that we can only have a posteriori knowledge of empirical objects. Any such knowledge is not necessary since it is derived from experience that can change. The lack of a priori knowledge of any particular cause-and-effect relations means that we cannot infer the future occurence of an event based on our past experience of the event’s pattern. Therefore, even with Kant’s contribution to synthetic a priori knowledge, we still cannot know for sure that a piece of paper will start burning when it is approached by fire. While Kant’s developments on epistemology are constructive and hugely significant, they might still need to go a few steps further to fully achieve a complete refutation of Humean scepticism.
<p>
In conclusion, Kant manages to establish some synthetic a priori knowledge of objects of experience in a way that weakens Hume’s scepticist system of beliefs. Most notably, Kant’s transcendental idealism and his ‘Copernican Turn’ in epistemology allow a study of the conditions that underlie human cognition itself rather than specific objects of experience. In that way, he arrives at pure concepts of the understanding like substance and causality, to which empirical objects must conform. Despite failing to reach the ‘complete solution of the Humean problem’, Kant’s line of argumentation here offers substantial insight into the world of knowledge and the human mind.
